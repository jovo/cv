abstract = "Cognitive phenotypes characterize our memories, beliefs, skills, and preferences, and arise from our ancestral, developmental, and experiential histories. These histories are written into our brain structure through the building and modification of various brain circuits. Connectal coding, by way of analogy with neural coding, is the art, study, and practice of identifying the network structures that link cognitive phenomena to individual histories. We propose a formal statistical framework for connectal coding and demonstrate its utility in several applications spanning experimental modalities and phylogeny."

               detected cancers of the ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas,

                   critical in a wide variety of domains. Efficiently and
                   accurately learning features for multiple graphs has
                   important applications in statistical inference on graphs.
                   We propose a method to jointly embed multiple undirected
                   graphs. Given a set of graphs, the joint embedding method
                   identifies a linear subspace spanned by rank one symmetric
                   matrices and projects adjacency matrices of graphs into this
                   subspace. The projection coefficients can be treated as
                   features of the graphs. We also propose a random graph model
                   which generalizes classical random graph model and can be
                   used to model multiple graphs. We show through theory and
                   numerical experiments that under the model, the joint
                   embedding method produces estimates of parameters with small
                   errors. Via simulation experiments, we demonstrate that the

                   of the art performance in classifying graphs. Applying the
                   joint embedding method to human brain graphs, we find it

               of multiple nodes. In contrast, we scale sparse matrix
               multiplication beyond memory capacity by implementing sparse
               matrix dense matrix multiplication (SpMM) in a semi-external
               memory (SEM) fashion; i.e., we keep the sparse matrix on

               incorporates many in-memory optimizations for large power-law

               quantify the overhead of keeping data on SSDs. SEM-SpMM achieves
               almost 100\% performance of IM-SpMM on graphs when the dense
               matrix has more than four columns; it achieves at least 65\%

abstract={For random graphs distributed according to stochastic blockmodels, a special case of latent position graphs, adjacency spectral embedding followed by appropriate vertex classification is asymptotically Bayes optimal; but this approach requires knowledge of and critically depends on the model dimension. In this paper, we propose a sparse representation vertex classifier which does not require information about the model dimension. This classifier represents a test vertex as a sparse combination of the vertices in the training set and uses the recovered coefficients to classify the test vertex. We prove consistency of our proposed classifier for stochastic blockmodels, and demonstrate that the sparse representation classifier can predict vertex labels with higher accuracy than adjacency spectral embedding approaches via both simulation studies and real data experiments. Our results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed vertex classifier when the model dimension is unknown.},

abstract={Resurgent interest in synaptic circuitry and plasticity has emphasized the importance of 3D reconstruction from serial section electron microscopy (3DEM). Three volumes of hippocampal CA1 neuropil from adult rat were imaged at X-Y resolution of ~2 nm on serial sections of ~50–60 nm thickness. These are the first densely reconstructed hippocampal volumes. All axons, dendrites, glia, and synapses were reconstructed in a cube (~10 μm3) surrounding a large dendritic spine, a cylinder (~43 μm3) surrounding an oblique dendritic segment (3.4 μm long), and a parallelepiped (~178 μm3) surrounding an apical dendritic segment (4.9 μm long). The data provide standards for identifying ultrastructural objects in 3DEM, realistic reconstructions for modeling biophysical properties of synaptic transmission, and a test bed for enhancing reconstruction tools. Representative synapses are quantified from varying section planes, and microtubules, polyribosomes, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and endosomes are identified and reconstructed in a subset of dendrites. The original images, traces, and Reconstruct software and files are freely available and visualized at the Open Connectome Project},

We explore these data to study physical properties of brain tissue. For example, by tracing the trajectories of all excitatory axons and noting their juxtapositions, both synaptic and non-synaptic, with every dendritic spine we refute the idea that physical proximity is sufficient to predict synaptic connectivity (the so-called Peters’ rule). This online minable database provides general access to the intrinsic complexity of the neocortex and enables further data-driven inquiries.},

                   of data, such as whether a connectome or genome has
                   information about disease status, is becoming increasingly
                   important in modern biological datasets. While existing
                   approaches can test whether two properties are related, they
                   often require unfeasibly large sample sizes in real data
                   scenarios, and do not provide any insight into how or why
                   the procedure reached its decision. Our approach,
                   ``Multiscale Graph Correlation'' (MGC), is a dependence test
                   that juxtaposes previously disparate data science
                   techniques, including k-nearest neighbors, kernel methods
                   (such as support vector machines), and multiscale analysis
                   (such as wavelets). Other methods typically require double
                   or triple the number samples to achieve the same statistical
                   power as MGC in a benchmark suite including high-dimensional
                   and nonlinear relationships - spanning polynomial (linear,
                   quadratic, cubic), trigonometric (sinusoidal, circular,
                   ellipsoidal, spiral), geometric (square, diamond, W-shape),
                   and other functions, with dimensionality ranging from 1 to
                   1000. Moreover, MGC uniquely provides a simple and elegant
                   characterization of the potentially complex latent geometry
                   underlying the relationship, providing insight while
                   maintaining computational efficiency. In several real data
                   applications, including brain imaging and cancer genetics,
                   MGC is the only method that can both detect the presence of
                   a dependency and provide specific guidance for the next
                   experiment and/or analysis to conduct.",

                   are leading methods for two-sample and independence tests
                   from the statistics community. Kernel methods, developed
                   from ``kernel mean embeddings'', are leading methods for
                   two-sample and independence tests from the machine learning
                   community. Previous works demonstrated the equivalence of
                   distance and kernel methods only at the population level,
                   for each kind of test, requiring an embedding theory of
                   kernels. We propose a simple, bijective transformation

                   for finite samples, two-sample tests are special cases of
                   independence tests, and the distance-based statistic is
                   equivalent to the kernel-based statistic, including the
                   biased, unbiased, and normalized versions. In other words,
                   upon setting the kernel or metric to be bijective of each
                   other, running any of the four algorithms will yield the

  abstract      = "Understanding and developing a correlation measure that can
                   detect general dependencies is not only imperative to
                   statistics and machine learning, but also crucial to general
                   scientific discovery in the big data age. We proposed the
                   Multiscale Generalized Correlation (MGC) in Shen et al. 2017
                   as a novel correlation measure, which worked well
                   empirically and helped a number of real data discoveries.
                   But there is a wide gap with respect to the theoretical
                   side, e.g., the population statistic, the convergence from
                   sample to population, how well does the algorithmic Sample
                   MGC perform, etc. To better understand its underlying
                   mechanism, in this paper we formalize the population version
                   of local distance correlations, MGC, and the optimal local
                   scale between the underlying random variables, by utilizing
                   the characteristic functions and incorporating the
                   nearest-neighbor machinery. The population version enables a
                   seamless connection with, and significant improvement to,
                   the algorithmic Sample MGC, both theoretically and in
                   practice, which further allows a number of desirable
                   asymptotic and finite-sample properties to be proved and
                   explored for MGC. The advantages of MGC are further
                   illustrated via a comprehensive set of simulations with
                   linear, nonlinear, univariate, multivariate, and noisy
                   dependencies, where it loses almost no power against

As such, it executes R code in parallel and out of core automatically. FlashMatrix uses vectorized user-defined functions (VUDF) to reduce the overhead of function calls and fuses matrix operations to reduce data movement between CPU and SSDs. We implement multiple machine learning algorithms in R to benchmark the performance of FlashMatrix. On a large parallel machine, out-of-core execution of these R implementations in FlashMatrix has performance comparable to in-memory execution on a billion-scale dataset while significantly outperforming the in-memory implementations of Spark MLlib.}

@article{Roncal2015b,
abstract={Reconstructing a map of neuronal connectivity is a critical challenge in contemporary neuroscience. Recent advances in high-throughput serial section electron microscopy (EM) have produced massive 3D image volumes of nanoscale brain tissue for the first time. The resolution of EM allows for individual neurons and their synaptic connections to be directly observed. Recovering neuronal networks by manually tracing each neuronal process at this scale is unmanageable, and therefore researchers are developing automated image processing modules. Thus far, state-of-the-art algorithms focus only on the solution to a particular task (e.g., neuron segmentation or synapse identification).
In this manuscript we present the first fully automated images-to-graphs pipeline (i.e., a pipeline that begins with an imaged volume of neural tissue and produces a brain graph without any human interaction). To evaluate overall performance and select the best parameters and methods, we also develop a metric to assess the quality of the output graphs. We evaluate a set of algorithms and parameters, searching possible operating points to identify the best available brain graph for our assessment metric. Finally, we deploy a reference end-to-end version of the pipeline on a large, publicly available data set. This provides a baseline result and framework for community analysis and future algorithm development and testing. All code and data derivatives have been made publicly available toward eventually unlocking new biofidelic computational primitives and understanding of neuropathologies.},

@article{Vogelstein2011c,
abstract = {Although it has been over a century since neuroscientists first conjectured that networks of neurons comprise the brain, technology has limited high-throughput investigations of neural circuitry until very recently. In the last couple of decades, several experimental paradigms have arisen that are poised to finally begin studying neuroanatomy in a high-throughput fashion. In 2005, the term connectome was coined independently by Patric Hagmann and Olaf Sporns, to describe the complete set of neural connections in a brain. Interestingly, both usages seemed to be referring to using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to study human brain networks. Shortly thereafter, Narayanan "Bobby" Kasthuri and Jeff Lichtman published an article suggesting that "connectome" should refer to connections between neurons, which one can infer using Electron Microscopy (EM) and fluorescence microscopy (e.g., brainbow animals). "Projectome", they suggested, is more appropriate for MRI based studies. Yet, the word connectome stuck, and now refers to essentially any neuroscientific investigation of the relationship between (collections of) neurons, be they functional or structural.},

This protocol describes bulk loading of brain slices with acetoxymethyl (AM) ester calcium indicators to monitor action-potential activity in functional neuronal circuits. The imaging of calcium influx into neurons provides an indirect but accurate measure of action-potential generation within individual neurons. The key advantage of the technique is that it allows the researcher to densely sample the activity of a large population of neurons with single-cell resolution.},

@article{Vogelstein2013,
abstract = {This manuscript considers the following "graph classification" question: Given a collection of graphs and associated classes, how can one predict the class of a newly observed graph? To address this question, we propose a statistical model for graph/class pairs. This model naturally leads to a set of estimators to identify the class-conditional signal, or "signal-subgraph," defined as the collection of edges that are probabilistically different between the classes. The estimators admit classifiers which are asymptotically optimal and efficient, but which differ by their assumption about the "coherency" of the signal-subgraph (coherency is the extent to which the signal-edges "stick together" around a common subset of vertices). Via simulation, the best estimator is shown to be not just a function of the coherency of the model, but also the number of training samples. These estimators are employed to address a contemporary neuroscience question: Can we classify "connectomes" (brain-graphs) according to sex? The answer is yes, and significantly better than all benchmark algorithms considered. Synthetic data analysis demonstrates that even when the model is correct, given the relatively small number of training samples, the estimated signal-subgraph should be taken with a grain of salt. We conclude by discussing several possible extensions.},

abstract = {The analysis of data requires computation: originally by hand and more recently by computers. Different models of computing are designed and optimized for different kinds of data. In data-intensive science, the scale and complexity of data exceeds the comfort zone of local data stores on scientific workstations. Thus, cloud computing emerges as the preeminent model, utilizing data centers and high-performance clusters, enabling remote users to access and query subsets of the data efficiently. We examine how data-intensive computational systems originally built for cosmology, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), are now being used in connectomics, at the Open Connectome Project. We list lessons learned and outline the top challenges we expect to face. Success in computational connectomics would drastically reduce the time between idea and discovery, as SDSS did in cosmology.},

abstract = {Allelic deletions involving the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p13-21.1) have been observed frequently in cervical carcinomas. Recently, a candidate tumor suppressor gene, FHIT (Fragile Histidine Triad), was cloned and mapped to this chromosomal region (3p14.2). Abnormal FHIT transcripts have been identified previously in a variety of tumor cell lines and primary carcinomas, although their significance and the molecular mechanisms underlying their origin remain incompletely defined. In addition, integration of human papillomavirus DNA has been identified at a fragile site (FRA3B) within the FHIT locus in cervical cancer. These observations motivated us to evaluate FHIT mRNA and protein expression in cervical cancer cell lines, primary cervical carcinomas, and normal tissues. Transcripts of the expected size and sequence were the predominant species identified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR in cultured keratinocytes and all normal tissues evaluated. In contrast, aberrant FHIT transcripts were readily demonstrated in 6 of 7 cervical carcinoma cell lines and 17 of 25 (68\%) primary cervical carcinomas. Northern blot analyses demonstrated reduced or absent FHIT expression in the cervical carcinoma cell lines, particularly those with aberrant RT-PCR products. Immunohistochemical analysis of Fhit expression in cervical tissues revealed strong immunoreactivity in nonneoplastic squamous and glandular cervical epithelium and marked reduction or loss of Fhit protein in 25 of 33 (76\%) primary cervical carcinomas. In those cervical cancer cell lines and primary tumors with exclusively aberrant or absent FHIT transcripts by RT-PCR, Fhit protein expression was always markedly reduced or absent. The frequent alterations in FHIT expression in many cervical carcinomas, but not in normal tissues, suggest that FHIT gene alterations may play an important role in cervical tumorigenesis.},

abstract = {A mixed-signal very large scale integration (VLSI) chip for large scale emulation of spiking neural networks is presented. The chip contains 2400 silicon neurons with fully programmable and reconfigurable synaptic connectivity. Each neuron implements a discrete-time model of a single-compartment cell. The model allows for analog membrane dynamics and an arbitrary number of synaptic connections, each with tunable conductance and reversal potential. The array of silicon neurons functions as an address-event (AE) transceiver, with incoming and outgoing spikes communicated over an asynchronous event-driven digital bus. Address encoding and conflict resolution of spiking events are implemented via a randomized arbitration scheme that ensures balanced servicing of event requests across the array. Routing of events is implemented externally using dynamically programmable random-access memory that stores a postsynaptic address, the conductance, and the reversal potential of each synaptic connection. Here, we describe the silicon neuron circuits, present experimental data characterizing the 3 mm x 3 mm chip fabricated in 0.5-microm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology, and demonstrate its utility by configuring the hardware to emulate a model of attractor dynamics and waves of neural activity during sleep in rat hippocampus.},

abstract = {As recent advances in calcium sensing technologies facilitate simultaneously imaging action potentials in neuronal populations, complementary analytical tools must also be developed to maximize the utility of this experimental paradigm. Although the observations here are fluorescence movies, the signals of interest--spike trains and/or time varying intracellular calcium concentrations--are hidden. Inferring these hidden signals is often problematic due to noise, nonlinearities, slow imaging rate, and unknown biophysical parameters. We overcome these difficulties by developing sequential Monte Carlo methods (particle filters) based on biophysical models of spiking, calcium dynamics, and fluorescence. We show that even in simple cases, the particle filters outperform the optimal linear (i.e., Wiener) filter, both by obtaining better estimates and by providing error bars. We then relax a number of our model assumptions to incorporate nonlinear saturation of the fluorescence signal, as well external stimulus and spike history dependence (e.g., refractoriness) of the spike trains. Using both simulations and in vitro fluorescence observations, we demonstrate temporal superresolution by inferring when within a frame each spike occurs. Furthermore, the model parameters may be estimated using expectation maximization with only a very limited amount of data (e.g., approximately 5-10 s or 5-40 spikes), without the requirement of any simultaneous electrophysiology or imaging experiments.},

abstract = {State space methods have proven indispensable in neural data analysis. However, common methods for performing inference in state-space models with non-Gaussian observations rely on certain approximations which are not always accurate. Here we review direct optimization methods that avoid these approximations, but that nonetheless retain the computational efficiency of the approximate methods. We discuss a variety of examples, applying these direct optimization techniques to problems in spike train smoothing, stimulus decoding, parameter estimation, and inference of synaptic properties. Along the way, we point out connections to some related standard statistical methods, including spline smoothing and isotonic regression. Finally, we note that the computational methods reviewed here do not in fact depend on the state-space setting at all; instead, the key property we are exploiting involves the bandedness of certain matrices. We close by discussing some applications of this more general point of view, including Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for neural decoding and efficient estimation of spatially-varying firing rates.},

abstract = {Fluorescent calcium indicators are becoming increasingly popular as a means for observing the spiking activity of large neuronal populations. Unfortunately, extracting the spike train of each neuron from a raw fluorescence movie is a nontrivial problem. This work presents a fast nonnegative deconvolution filter to infer the approximately most likely spike train of each neuron, given the fluorescence observations. This algorithm outperforms optimal linear deconvolution (Wiener filtering) on both simulated and biological data. The performance gains come from restricting the inferred spike trains to be positive (using an interior-point method), unlike the Wiener filter. The algorithm runs in linear time, and is fast enough that even when simultaneously imaging >100 neurons, inference can be performed on the set of all observed traces faster than real time. Performing optimal spatial filtering on the images further refines the inferred spike train estimates. Importantly, all the parameters required to perform the inference can be estimated using only the fluorescence data, obviating the need to perform joint electrophysiological and imaging calibration experiments.},

abstract = {Deducing the structure of neural circuits is one of the central problems of modern neuroscience. Recently-introduced calcium fluorescent imaging methods permit experimentalists to observe network activity in large populations of neurons, but these techniques provide only indirect observations of neural spike trains, with limited time resolution and signal quality. In this work we present a Bayesian approach for inferring neural circuitry given this type of imaging data. We model the network activity in terms of a collection of coupled hidden Markov chains, with each chain corresponding to a single neuron in the network and the coupling between the chains reflecting the network's connectivity matrix. We derive a Monte Carlo Expectation--Maximization algorithm for fitting the model parameters; to obtain the sufficient statistics in a computationally-efficient manner, we introduce a specialized blockwise-Gibbs algorithm for sampling from the joint activity of all observed neurons given the observed fluorescence data. We perform large-scale simulations of randomly connected neuronal networks with biophysically realistic parameters and find that the proposed methods can accurately infer the connectivity in these networks given reasonable experimental and computational constraints. In addition, the estimation accuracy may be improved significantly by incorporating prior knowledge about the sparseness of connectivity in the network, via standard L\$\_1\$ penalization methods.},

abstract = {Neuronal responses during sensory processing are influenced by both the organization of intracortical connections and the statistical features of sensory stimuli. How these intrinsic and extrinsic factors govern the activity of excitatory and inhibitory populations is unclear. Using two-photon calcium imaging in vivo and intracellular recordings in vitro, we investigated the dependencies between synaptic connectivity, feature selectivity and network activity in pyramidal cells and fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing (PV) interneurons in mouse visual cortex. In pyramidal cell populations, patterns of neuronal correlations were largely stimulus-dependent, indicating that their responses were not strongly dominated by functionally biased recurrent connectivity. By contrast, visual stimulation only weakly modified co-activation patterns of fast-spiking PV cells, consistent with the observation that these broadly tuned interneurons received very dense and strong synaptic input from nearby pyramidal cells with diverse feature selectivities. Therefore, feedforward and recurrent network influences determine the activity of excitatory and inhibitory ensembles in fundamentally different ways.},

abstract = {The "mind-brain supervenience" conjecture suggests that all mental properties are derived from the physical properties of the brain. To address the question of whether the mind supervenes on the brain, we frame a supervenience hypothesis in rigorous statistical terms. Specifically, we propose a modified version of supervenience (called $\epsilon$-supervenience) that is amenable to experimental investigation and statistical analysis. To illustrate this approach, we perform a thought experiment that illustrates how the probabilistic theory of pattern recognition can be used to make a one-sided determination of $\epsilon$-supervenience. The physical property of the brain employed in this analysis is the graph describing brain connectivity (i.e., the brain-graph or connectome). $\epsilon$-supervenience allows us to determine whether a particular mental property can be inferred from one's connectome to within any given positive misclassification rate, regardless of the relationship between the two. This may provide further motivation for cross-disciplinary research between neuroscientists and statisticians.},

@article{Roberts2012,
abstract = {New DNA sequencing methods will soon make it possible to identify all germline variants in any individual at a reasonable cost. However, the ability of whole-genome sequencing to predict predisposition to common diseases in the general population is unknown. To estimate this predictive capacity, we use the concept of a "genometype." A specific genometype represents the genomes in the population conferring a specific level of genetic risk for a specified disease. Using this concept, we estimated the maximum capacity of whole-genome sequencing to identify individuals at clinically significant risk for 24 different diseases. Our estimates were derived from the analysis of large numbers of monozygotic twin pairs; twins of a pair share the same genometype and therefore identical genetic risk factors. Our analyses indicate that (i) for 23 of the 24 diseases, most of the individuals will receive negative test results; (ii) these negative test results will, in general, not be very informative, because the risk of developing 19 of the 24 diseases in those who test negative will still be, at minimum, 50 to 80\% of that in the general population; and (iii) on the positive side, in the best-case scenario, more than 90\% of tested individuals might be alerted to a clinically significant predisposition to at least one disease. These results have important implications for the valuation of genetic testing by industry, health insurance companies, public policy-makers, and consumers.},

abstract = {For random graphs distributed according to a stochastic block model, we consider the inferential task of partitioning vertices into blocks using spectral techniques. Spectral partitioning using the normalized Laplacian and the adjacency matrix have both been shown to be consistent as the number of vertices tend to infinity. Importantly, both procedures require that the number of blocks and the rank of the communication probability matrix be known, even as the rest of the parameters may be unknown. In this paper, we prove that the (suitably modified) adjacency-spectral partitioning procedure, requiring only an upper bound on the rank of the communication probability matrix, is consistent. Indeed, this result demonstrates a robustness to model mis-specification; an overestimate of the rank may impose a moderate performance penalty, but the procedure is still consistent. Furthermore, we extend this procedure to the setting where adjacencies may have multiple modalities and we allow for either directed or und...},

In the age of big data, graph valued data is becoming more prominent, and with it, a desire to run algorithms on ever larger graphs. Because QAP is NP-hard, exact algorithms are intractable. Approximate algorithms necessarily employ an accuracy/efficiency trade-off. We developed a fast approximate quadratic assignment algorithm (FAQ). FAQ finds a local optima in (worst case) time cubic in the number of vertices, similar to other approximate QAP algorithms. We demonstrate empirically that our algorithm is faster and achieves a lower objective value on over 80\% of the suite of QAP benchmarks, compared with the previous state-of-the-art. Applying the algorithms to our motivating example, matching C. elegans connectomes (brain-graphs), we find that FAQ achieves the optimal performance in record time, whereas none of the others even find the optimum.},

We propose a general class of algorithms for parallelizing computations to dramatically speed up computation time by orders of magnitude exploiting multicore architectures. We implement our algorithm on a cloud computing platform, providing pseudo and actual code. The algorithm can be easily implemented on any multicore parallel computing resource. Some illustrations are provided to give a flavor for the gains and what becomes possible in freeing up this bottleneck.},

abstract = {Machine learning is a popular method for mining and analyzing large collections of medical data. We focus on a particular problem from medical research, supervised multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation in structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We examine the extent to which the choice of machine learning or classification algorithm and feature extraction function impacts the performance of lesion segmentation methods. As quantitative measures derived from structural MRI are important clinical tools for research into the pathophysiology and natural history of MS, the development of automated lesion segmentation methods is an active research field. Yet, little is known about what drives performance of these methods. We evaluate the performance of automated MS lesion segmentation methods, which consist of a supervised classification algorithm composed with a feature extraction function. These feature extraction functions act on the observed T1-weighted (T1-w), T2-weighted (T2-w) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI voxel intensities. Each MRI study has a manual lesion segmentation that we use to train and validate the supervised classification algorithms. Our main finding is that the differences in predictive performance are due more to differences in the feature vectors, rather than the machine learning or classification algorithms. Features that incorporate information from neighboring voxels in the brain were found to increase performance substantially. For lesion segmentation, we conclude that it is better to use simple, interpretable, and fast algorithms, such as logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and quadratic discriminant analysis, and to develop the features to improve performance.},

That is, the existence of an edge between two vertices is based on some imperfect assessment. In this paper, we consider a graph G = (V,E). We wish to perform an inference task - the it surrogate inference task considered here is "vertex classification". However, we do not observe G; rather, for each potential edge uv in Vchoose2 we observe an "edge-feature" which we use to classify uv as edge/not-edge. Thus we it errorfully observe G when we observe the graph widetildeG = (V,widetildeE). Moreover, we face a quantity/quality trade-off regarding the edge-features we observe - more informative edge-features are more expensive, and hence the number of potential edges that can be assessed decreases with the quality of the edge-features. We derive the optimal quantity/quality operating point for subsequent graph inference in the face of this trade-off.},

Recent advances in high-throughput electron microscopy have produced massive images of nanoscale brain tissue for the first time. This resolution allows for individual neurons and their synaptic connections to be directly observed. Manually tracing each neuronal process at this scale is unmanageable, and therefore researchers are developing automated image processing modules. Thus far, state-of-the-art algorithms focus only on the solution to a particular task (e.g., neuron segmentation or synapse identification).
We have created the first fully automated images-to-graphs pipeline (i.e., a pipeline that begins with an imaged volume of neural tissue and produces a brain graph without any human interaction). To evaluate overall performance and select the best parameters and methods, we also develop a metric to assess the quality of the output graphs. We demonstrate our pipeline by selecting a set of algorithms and parameters, and search possible operating points to identify the best available brain graph. New algorithms can be easily integrated into our scalable pipeline, and used to improve results and facilitate analysis.},
